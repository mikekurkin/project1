# Project 1

This is a book review app. It uses the Goodreads API to retrieve information about book rating and the OpenLibrary API to show a cover art picture. User can search for a specific book and, if logged in, write a review, which will be stored in a database and shown on a book page. Main page has multiple randomly selected, quote unquote, featured books.
